## Summary
In conclusion, this webpage is an interactive way for those interested to search for specific information regarding UFO sightings. One major drawback of this format though, is that the user must be exact with the specifications they are looking for. For example, the cities and states are case sensitive to match the dataset. This is why the prompt in the box is lowercase, as the rest of the dataset is. To improve upon this design, it is recommended to permit the filter buttons to match similar texts where case and spacing does not matter. 

Another option that might work well, particularly since this is a relatively small dataset at the moment, would be to have dropdown options instead. This would eliminate trial and error when searching for cities or dates that aren’t in the data set.
